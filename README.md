# Stock Data Extraction and Visualization

## Overview

In this notebook, I extracted and visualized stock data, focusing on extracting essential data from a dataset and displaying it to facilitate informed decision-making. This assignment involves extracting stock data for two companies, GameStop and Tesla, along with their respective revenue data. The data was scraped from the web, analyzed, and graphically represented to derive meaningful insights.

## Objectives

- **Data Extraction**: Scrape stock and revenue data for GameStop and Tesla from the web.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the extracted data to identify key trends and insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Graph the results in a visually appealing manner to support data-driven decision-making.

## Steps Involved

1. **Web Scraping**: Use BeautifulSoup to scrape stock and revenue data for GameStop and Tesla.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Process and clean the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. **Data Analysis**: Perform analysis to extract meaningful insights from the data.
4. **Data Visualization**: Create visually appealing graphs to display the analyzed data.

## Libraries Used

- `yfinance`: For fetching stock data.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `BeautifulSoup`: For web scraping.
- `plotly.graph_objects`: For creating interactive visualizations.
- `plotly.subplots`: For creating subplots in visualizations.

## Data Sources

- **GameStop Stock and Revenue Data**
- **Tesla Stock and Revenue Data**

## Insights and Findings

- Extracted stock data and revenue data were analyzed to identify key trends.
- Visualizations were created to highlight these trends, making it easier to interpret the data.
